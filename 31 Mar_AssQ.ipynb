    "- **Single Point of Failure**: If the server goes down, the hosted applications may become unavailable until the issue is resolved.\n",
    "- **Cost Structure**: Usually has a fixed cost based on the selected hosting plan, regardless of resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Hosting**:\n",
    "- **Infrastructure**: Utilizes a distributed network of servers in the cloud, providing high availability and redundancy.\n",
    "- **Scalable Resources**: Resources can be dynamically allocated based on demand, allowing for automatic scaling.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Offers the ability to quickly deploy, scale, and manage applications using cloud services.\n",
    "- **Redundancy and Resilience**: Built-in redundancy across multiple data centers, reducing the risk of downtime.\n",
    "- **Cost Structure**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model, where costs are based on actual resource usage (e.g., compute, storage, bandwidth).\n",
