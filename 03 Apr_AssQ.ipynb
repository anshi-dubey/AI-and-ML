    "- **Precision**: It measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. Specifically, precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.\n",

    "  Precision answers the question: \"Of all instances the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?\"\n",

    "**Logistic regression** can be extended to handle multiclass classification through techniques like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: This approach involves training a separate binary classifier for each class, where each classifier predicts whether the instance belongs to that class or not. The final prediction is the class with the highest confidence score.\n",
    "- **Softmax Regression (Multinomial Logistic Regression)**: In this approach, logistic regression is generalized to multiple classes by using the softmax function. The softmax function outputs a probability distribution over all classes, and the class with the highest probability is selected as the final prediction.\n",
