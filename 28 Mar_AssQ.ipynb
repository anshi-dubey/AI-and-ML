    "**Ridge Regression**:\n",
    "- **Concept**: Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term (specifically, L2 regularization) in the loss function. This regularization penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients, effectively shrinking them and reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**:\n",
    "  - **OLS**: The goal of ordinary least squares regression is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values).\n",
    "  - **Loss Function**: In OLS, the loss function is:\n",
    "    $$ \\ [\n",
    "    \\text{Minimize } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",

    "  - **Ridge**: Ridge regression adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of the squared coefficients to the OLS loss function.\n",
    "  - **Loss Function**: The Ridge loss function is:\n",
    "    $$ \\ [\n",
    "    \\text{Minimize } \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2\n",

    "- **Difference from OLS**:\n",
    "  - **Regularization**: Ridge regression includes a regularization term that OLS does not. This regularization term helps to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients, particularly in cases where multicollinearity is present or when the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.\n",
    "  - **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Ridge regression introduces bias into the model by shrinking coefficients, but this tradeoff can lead to lower variance and better generalization to new data.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **No Perfect Multicollinearity**: While Ridge regression can handle multicollinearity, it assumes that the predictors are not perfectly collinear. Perfect multicollinearity would make it impossible to estimate coefficients.\n",

    "  1. The data is split into k subsets (folds).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Grid Search**: Another approach is to perform a grid search over a range of possible $\\ ( \\lambda \\ )$ values. The model is trained and validated on a predefined grid of $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ values, and the one with the best performance (e.g., lowest error) is selected.\n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",
    "- **Indirect Feature Selection**:\n",
    "  - **Comparison with Lasso**: Unlike Lasso (L1 regularization), which can shrink some coefficients to zero, Ridge regression generally keeps all coefficients non-zero. However, Ridge regression can be used as a part of a broader feature selection strategy.\n",
    "  - **Feature Importance**: After applying Ridge regression, the magnitude of the coefficients can be analyzed to identify the most and least important features. Features with very small coefficients may contribute little to the model and can be considered for removal in a subsequent analysis.\n",

    "**Ridge Regression in the Presence of Multicollinearity**:\n",

    "  - **Improved Predictive Accuracy**: By reducing the impact of multicollinear variables, Ridge regression can improve the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which can have inflated standard errors and unreliable coefficients in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "  - **Interpretation**: While Ridge regression helps mitigate the problems associated with multicollinearity, the resulting coefficients are biased. However, this bias is often offset by the reduced variance, leading to a better overall model.\n",

    "  - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Before applying Ridge regression, categorical variables must be converted into a numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding, where each category is represented by a binary variable.\n",
    "  - **Impact on Multicollinearity**: One-hot encoding can increase the risk of multicollinearity, especially when many categories are present. However, Ridge regression's ability to handle multicollinearity makes it well-suited for models with a mix of categorical and continuous variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Effect of Regularization**:\n",
    "  - **Shrinkage**: Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, so the coefficients are typically smaller in magnitude compared to OLS regression. The amount of shrinkage depends on the value of the regularization parameter \\( \\lambda \\).\n",
