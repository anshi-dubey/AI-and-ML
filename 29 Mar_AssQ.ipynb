    "### Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression**:\n",
    "- **Concept**: Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a type of linear regression that adds a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss function. This regularization term is based on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 norm). The Lasso penalty shrinks some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection and leading to simpler, more interpretable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lasso vs. Other Regression Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **OLS Regression**: OLS aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals without any regularization, which can lead to overfitting, especially when the model has many predictors or multicollinearity.\n",
    "  - **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression adds an L2 penalty (sum of squared coefficients) to the OLS loss function, shrinking the coefficients but generally not setting any to zero. Ridge is more suited for situations where all predictors contribute to the outcome but need regularization.\n",
    "  - **Lasso Regression**: Lasso differs from Ridge by using an L1 penalty, which can shrink coefficients to zero, thereby performing feature selection. This makes Lasso particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when trying to identify the most important predictors.\n",

    "### Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Advantage of Lasso Regression in Feature Selection**:\n",
    "- **Automatic Feature Selection**: The primary advantage of Lasso Regression is its ability to perform automatic feature selection. The L1 regularization term penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, leading some coefficients to be exactly zero when the penalty is sufficiently strong. This effectively removes irrelevant or less important features from the model, simplifying the model and potentially improving its interpretability and generalization to new data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Sparse Solutions**: By driving some coefficients to zero, Lasso provides a sparse solution, meaning the model only uses a subset of the original features. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations, or when there is a need to reduce the complexity of the model.\n",

    "### Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting Lasso Regression Coefficients**:\n",
    "- **Magnitude and Sign**:\n",
    "  - Like in other linear regression models, the magnitude and sign of the coefficients in a Lasso Regression model indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable.\n",
    "  - A positive coefficient indicates a direct relationship, while a negative coefficient indicates an inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "  - **Zero Coefficients**: If a coefficient is exactly zero, it means that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model. Lasso effectively identifies and removes features that do not contribute significantly to predicting the outcome.\n",
    "  - **Non-Zero Coefficients**: Non-zero coefficients represent the features that are included in the model. The larger the absolute value of the coefficient, the stronger the featureâ€™s influence on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact of Regularization**:\n",
    "  - The regularization parameter (lambda, $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ determines the strength of the penalty. As  $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ increases, more coefficients may be shrunk to zero, leading to a simpler model. If $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ is too large, important features might be excluded, potentially leading to underfitting.\n",
    "  - Interpreting Lasso coefficients requires considering the chosen value of $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$, as different values can lead to different sets of included features.\n",

    "### Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuning Parameters in Lasso Regression**:\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameter (Lambda, $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$)**:\n",
    "  - **Role**: The regularization parameter $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ controls the strength of the L1 penalty applied to the coefficients. It is the most critical parameter in Lasso Regression.\n",
    "  - **Effect on Model Performance**:\n",
    "    - **Small $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$**: A small $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ value leads to minimal regularization, causing the model to behave more like ordinary least squares regression, with little to no feature selection.\n",
    "    - **Large $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$**: A large $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$ value increases the penalty on the coefficients, leading to more coefficients being shrunk to zero. This results in a sparser model with fewer features, potentially improving generalization but also risking underfitting if important features are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Parameters**:\n",
    "  - **Alpha** (for Elastic Net): When combining Lasso with Ridge regression in Elastic Net, the  $\\ ( \\ alpha \\ )$ parameter controls the mixing ratio between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. An $\\ ( \\ alpha \\ )$ of 1 corresponds to pure Lasso, while an $\\ ( \\ alpha \\ )$ of 0 corresponds to pure Ridge.\n",
    "  - **Max Iterations**: The maximum number of iterations for the optimization algorithm can also be adjusted. Higher values can ensure convergence but may increase computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "  - Cross-validation is often used to select the optimal value of $\\ ( \\ lambda \\ )$. By evaluating the model's performance across different values of \\( \\lambda \\), the value that minimizes prediction error or another relevant metric can be chosen.\n",

    "### Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression for Non-Linear Problems**:\n",
    "- **Direct Use**: Lasso Regression itself is a linear model, meaning it assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable. However, non-linear relationships can be modeled by transforming the input features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "  - **Polynomial Features**: One common approach is to create polynomial features (e.g., square, cubic terms) or interaction terms from the original features. By applying Lasso Regression to these transformed features, the model can capture non-linear relationships.\n",
    "  - **Basis Functions**: Another approach is to use basis functions (e.g., splines, Fourier series) to transform the predictors, allowing the linear model to capture non-linear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kernel Methods**:\n",
    "  - Lasso can also be used in combination with kernel methods, where the original data is mapped to a higher-dimensional space using a non-linear kernel function. Lasso can then be applied to the transformed features in this higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations**: While these transformations allow Lasso to handle non-linear relationships, the model remains fundamentally linear in the transformed features. More complex non-linear models (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) may be better suited for capturing highly non-linear relationships.\n",

    "  - **Ridge Regression**: Introduces bias by shrinking coefficients but generally retains lower variance, making it effective when all predictors are relevant.\n",

    "  - **Feature Selection**: Lasso can handle multicollinearity by performing feature selection. When faced with multicollinear predictors, Lasso may select only one variable from a group of correlated variables, shrinking the others to zero. This helps to reduce the redundancy and complexity in the model.\n",
