    "\n",
    "A **Decision Tree Classifier** is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds a model in the form of a tree structure, where:\n",
    "- **Each internal node** represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g., whether a person’s income is above or below a certain threshold).\n",
    "- **Each branch** represents the outcome of the test (e.g., income > $50K).\n",
    "- **Each leaf node** represents a class label (e.g., High Income, Low Income).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. **Splitting:** The algorithm starts at the root of the tree and splits the data based on the feature that provides the highest information gain or lowest Gini impurity.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Partitioning:** This process is repeated recursively for each child node, splitting the dataset further until one of the stopping criteria is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).\n",
    "3. **Prediction:** For a new data point, the tree traverses from the root to a leaf node, following the decisions based on the features. The class label at the leaf node is the predicted class for the data point.\n",
