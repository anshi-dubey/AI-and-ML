    "### Q1. What is the purpose of grid search CV in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "**Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV)** is a method used to systematically work through multiple combinations of hyperparameters to find the best model configuration. The \"grid\" in grid search refers to the Cartesian product of the hyperparameter space, where each point in the grid represents a set of hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. **Specify hyperparameters**: Define the range of values for each hyperparameter that you want to test.\n",
    "2. **Cross-validation**: For each combination of hyperparameters, grid search performs cross-validation (usually k-fold) on the training set.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate performance**: It evaluates the performance of the model for each combination based on a chosen metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).\n",
    "4. **Select the best model**: The combination of hyperparameters that yields the best performance is selected.\n",

    "### Q2. Describe the difference between grid search CV and random search CV, and when might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "**Grid Search CV** exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of the specified hyperparameters. This is comprehensive but can be computationally expensive, especially if the hyperparameter space is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Search CV** randomly samples a specified number of hyperparameter combinations from the grid, rather than trying all possible combinations. This is faster and can be more efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters or when some hyperparameters might have less impact on performance.\n",

    "- **Grid Search** is ideal when the hyperparameter space is small or when you want to ensure that you explore every possible combination.\n",

    "### Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "**Data leakage** occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates. This can happen if data that wouldn’t be available at prediction time leaks into the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why it’s a problem:**\n",
    "It leads to models that perform well on training data but fail to generalize to unseen data, because the model has effectively \"cheated\" by having access to future information that it wouldn’t have in a real-world scenario.\n",

    "2. **Feature engineering**: Only use features that would be available at the time of prediction.\n",
